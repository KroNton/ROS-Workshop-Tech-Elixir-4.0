# Hands-On: Launching Turtlebot 3 Simulation in Gazebo with ROS Noetic

This hands-on guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Turtlebot 3 simulation environment in Gazebo using ROS Noetic. You will clone the necessary repositories, build the ROS workspace, and launch a Turtlebot 3 simulation in an empty Gazebo world.

## Prerequisites
- A system with ROS Noetic installed.
- Gazebo simulation software installed.
- Basic familiarity with ROS and Linux terminal commands.

## Step 1: Create or Navigate to Your ROS Workspace
Before cloning the required repositories, make sure you have a ROS workspace set up.

1. **Create a ROS Workspace**:
   If you don't have a ROS workspace, create one and initialize it.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   catkin_make
   ```

   This creates a workspace called `catkin_ws` with a `src` directory for your ROS packages.

2. **Navigate to Your Workspace**:
   If you already have a workspace, navigate to it.

   ```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src
   ```

## Step 2: Clone the Turtlebot 3 Repositories
Clone the necessary repositories for Turtlebot 3 simulations, core software, and custom message types.

1. **Clone Turtlebot 3 Simulations**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
   ```

2. **Clone Turtlebot 3 Core Software**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
   ```

3. **Clone Turtlebot 3 Custom Messages**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b noetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
   ```

These repositories contain the simulation files, core software, and message definitions for Turtlebot 3.

## Step 3: Build the Workspace
After cloning the repositories, build your ROS workspace.

1. **Navigate to the Workspace Root**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   ```

2. **Build the Workspace with `catkin_make`**:
   ```bash
   catkin_make
   ```

   This command builds the entire workspace, compiling the cloned repositories into your ROS environment.

## Step 4: Source the Setup Script
To ensure ROS recognizes the new packages, source the setup script.

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

Consider adding this command to your `~/.bashrc` file to automatically source the setup script every time you open a new terminal.

```bash
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Step 5: Launch Turtlebot 3 Simulation in Gazebo
To run the simulation, set the appropriate Turtlebot 3 model and launch Gazebo.

1. **Set the Turtlebot 3 Model**:
   ```bash
   export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
   ```

   This command specifies the model of Turtlebot 3. The "burger" model is the most common.

2. **Launch Turtlebot 3 in Gazebo**:
   ```bash
   roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
   ```

   This command launches a Gazebo simulation with a Turtlebot 3 robot in an empty world.

## Conclusion
You have successfully set up a ROS workspace, cloned the Turtlebot 3 repositories, built the workspace, and launched a Turtlebot 3 simulation in Gazebo. You can now explore the capabilities of Turtlebot 3, experiment with ROS, and even create your own robotic applications in this simulation environment.

If you encounter issues, check for build errors, ensure ROS and Gazebo are properly installed, and double-check the repository URLs. Happy experimenting!
